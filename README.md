# cppTutorial
A repository of different cpp tutorials that I have performed 2 learn the language
# Design 4 Use  
Place to store cpp code examples.  First focusing on all of the different snippets and modules that are usefull
when making engineering applications.  This is training which I elected to engage upon to further my career.
The page is designed to provide myself with a place to keep all of this so that it is readily accessible over the years.
In applying these code snippets, the design is to make platform independent code.  The resulting executables will be 
platform specific.


# Compiler

Generally the plan is to write in gcc, and mingw.  This will allow me to compile programs and develop code on both linux
and windows machines.

## When writing in VS2017,VS2015,VS2013:
1) Install mingw
2) Setup mingw in VS version being run

## When writing in Eclipse Neon 
1) Install gcc compiler
2) Setup GCC compiler for your eclipse project
3) Setup GIT to sync the project
